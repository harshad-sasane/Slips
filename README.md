# BCA HTML Practical Slips – Personal Repository

This repository is my **personal, exam-oriented storage** for all **BCA (Sem-1) HTML & Web Designing practical slips**.  
It is structured for **fast revision, clean backup, and easy rewriting in the practical exam**.

This repo is **not meant for production or strict modern HTML standards**.  
It follows **college practical requirements, teacher instructions, and slip patterns**.

---

## Purpose

- Store all practical slips in **organized folders**
- Keep **HTML, CSS, frames, forms, tables, JavaScript** ready for revision
- Separate **JavaScript practice** from slip-wise programs
- Avoid scattered WhatsApp code dumps
- Make exam rewriting **fast and error-free**

## Folder Structure

```text
js_assi/        → JavaScript practice programs
slip01–slipXX/ → Individual practical slips (HTML/CSS/JS)

A/B Question Pattern

Some slips have two questions (a & b), so they are split like:

slip03/
├── a/   → HTML/CSS output
└── b/   → JavaScript logic

Frame-based Slips

Example:

slip07/
├── frame1.html
├── frame2.html
...
└── frameset_layout.html

Slips With Assets

slip01/
├── bg.jpeg
├── scaoc.jpg
└── college_intro.html


---

Coding Style (Exam-Oriented)

Short, compact code for easy writing on paper

<marquee> and <font> used because slips explicitly require them

<head> sometimes omitted as per teacher’s instructions for simple body/script pages

Focus is on correct output as per slip, not modern semantic HTML

Priority order: Exam output > Validation > “Best practices”



---

JavaScript Policy

General JS practice kept in js_assi/

Slip-wise JS added only after it is taught in class

Until then, HTML-only solutions are treated as valid for practicals

Note

This repo is optimized for:

Practical exam performance

Fast revision

Clean backup


It is a student workspace, not a production-ready web project.

You can tweak wording if you want it even shorter, but structurally this gives you:

- Clickable folders
- Direct entry points to each slip
- Clear view of what is done vs pending.0
